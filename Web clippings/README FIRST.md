There is a browser extension that lets you quickly rip web pages, or highlights of bits of web pages, directly into Obsidian.

It's quite powerful, has loads of options, but just the default settings are often good enough.

*RECOMMENDED*

If you can't find your clipping in here then check for a _Clippings_ folder. I've noticed the browser extension may be using that as a default.
