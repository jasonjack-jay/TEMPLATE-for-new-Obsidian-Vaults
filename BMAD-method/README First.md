# Why BMAD?
It's good.
Yes, there are others. 
Right now, as far as I can tell, this is the best.

# QUICK AND DIRTY GUIDE

The formatting may be a bit rough here…

# THIS DOC LAST UPDATED: _2025-12-05_

You should always check the website.

# README FIRST

BMAD is Open Source and very much a Work In Progress  
Which means IT CAN AND WILL CHANGE  
So, you really should check the home page every few days, to see what's new.

# VERSION 6

Is "in alpha" / "nearly beta" ... sounds rough, right? It is, and it isn't: As long as you stick to the defaults and stick to the BMM (BMAD Method) then you should be alright.

## What is the difference between BMAD Method (BMM) and BMAD Core?

BMM = The software development suite - This is what you want!  
BMAD Core = The underlying tech that was used to create BMM. Now a separate component: Can be used to create agents, workflows, tools, and tasks for any process. ANY PROCESS! ANYTHING!! Super powerful... (NOT READY YET - still in alpha)

# WHAT IS HERE

I'm not going to tell you how to install it, nor how to use it. RTFM please. This area is for tips, tricks, and the occasional warning

# Find BMAD here

RTFM that readme + the links there. Lots, right? Okay, fine, don’t read all of it. Why not make an AI agent that knows all about it so you can ask it questions as you go? See Professor BMAD below **😀**

# Install

RTFM please! This may have changed...  
Do this either in the root folder of the project you want to work in, or a new blank empty folder.

`npx bmad-method@alpha install`

Claude Code is, in my opinion, the best thing since sliced bread - you should definitely use it.

However, if you are going to try the other models then: Cursor should work. The ones with a **⭐** should also be good to use.

# FIRST USE

Try

`*workflow-init`

Try doing a greenfield app. Just something small. Not a game (it will want you to use the game dev specific agent set).

If you get lost *help should help, or copy/paste the current conversation into Professor BMAD and say e.g. “I’ve got this far with BMAD but I don’t know what to do next.“

Good luck!

# Don’t skimp the requirements

The dev loop will fabulous if you spend the time making your requirements very very good.

Definition of Good: 9 times out of 10 the dev loop produces excellent results

Definition of Bad: 5 times out of 10 the dev loop produces things that are not quite right

# Commit often

Because you never know when it is going to suddenly crap all over your work.

# Jay’s 45 minute rule

If you have an issue, and you get into a dialog with the AI about it, and you try several times but never quite get it right, then…

If 45 minutes have passed: Give Up. Restore from your last commit. Sometimes you may even need to go back more than 1 commit.
