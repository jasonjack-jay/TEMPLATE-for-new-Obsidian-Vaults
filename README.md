# About
This is Jay's highly opinionated idea on a good place to start with Obsidian. Not too much, not too little - Goldilocks level.

Please clone it / fork it / take a copy / ... and if you have any contributions then please either submit a PR or email me.

I hope you find it useful!

# Hello!
GitHub repositories usually have a README.md file in the root - hence this file.
As e're here, might as well say
# Welcome to this Vault
## An Obsidian vault
https://www.obsidian.md
### An opinionated starter template
Not much Content here. Checkout the Help folder.
This is more about plugins & settings than meaningfully useful content.
I deliberately left out anything to do with Personal Knowledge Management (PKM). If you want to know more then here is as good a starting point as any - https://matthiasfrank.de/en/personal-knowledge-management-for-beginners/ 
If there is demand, I will consider presenting a PKM course internally.
#### This vault _might_ be being shared with others
If it is, make sure you know the rules for sharing & contributing. Obsidian isn't designed for team sharing out of the box.

# IMPORTANT THINGS
## 1 - If this is being shared using git: DO NOT USE THIS VAULT ON MOBILE 
**(According to the git plugin docs bad things will happen)**
## 2 - Do not use funky characters in the title of a note
_Like > or < or : or ? (etc)_
because it breaks sharing for PC users
