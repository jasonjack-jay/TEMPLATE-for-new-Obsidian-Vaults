# About
This is Jay's highly opinionated idea on a good place to start with Obsidian. Not too much, not too little - just Goldilocks level.

## How to use

If you are planning to make a shared vault (shared using git) then the 'Use this template' github feature is for you.

If you are just setting up a new private vault then
- Don't use the 'Use this template'
- Probably the best idea is to download the zip and unzip it somewhere and rename the folder e.g. "My vault"
However, if you are planning to share your vault with yourself - across 2 or more machines - then git is as good a way as any. I've tried iCloud and Dropbox; iCloud works great (just make your folder within your iCloud drive), and Dropbox is okay-ish.

If you have any contributions then please either submit a PR or email me.

I hope you find this useful!

The original readme went like this:

# Hello World!
GitHub repositories usually have a README.md file in the root - hence this file.
As we are here, might as well say -
## Welcome to this Vault
### An Obsidian vault
https://www.obsidian.md
#### An opinionated starter template
Not much Content here. **Checkout the Help folder.**
This starter is more about plugins & settings I like than meaningfully useful content.
## PKM
I deliberately left out anything to do with Personal Knowledge Management. If you want to know more then here is as good a starting point as any - https://matthiasfrank.de/en/personal-knowledge-management-for-beginners/ 
If there is demand, I will consider presenting a PKM course internally.
#### This vault _might_ be being shared with others
If it is, make sure you know the rules for sharing & contributing. Obsidian isn't designed for team sharing out of the box.

# IMPORTANT THINGS
## 1 - If this is being shared using git: DO NOT USE THIS VAULT ON MOBILE 
**According to the git plugin docs bad things will happen**
## 2 - Do not use funky characters in the title of a note
_Like > or < or : or ? (etc)_
because it breaks sharing for PC users
